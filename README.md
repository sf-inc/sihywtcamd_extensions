# So I heard you were talking crap about Minecraft's difficulty ?

**Extension mod!**  
This one is ***required*** on client.

## Description

This mod aims to increase Minecraft's difficulty. Basically, almost
every hostile mob has been reworked, from small changes to huge ones.
Some of them are inspired by the Bedrock edition, which is a bit
different (and often harder) than the Java one.
Although we've changed almost every mob already, feel free to ask for
new features or changes in the comment section. Indeed, don't
hesitate to share your experience and tell me if you think I should
tweak anything to make the experience even better =)
